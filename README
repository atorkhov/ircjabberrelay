Forwards messages between IRC channel and Jabber conference.

To use:

* Checkout current version of wokkel muc client support branch:
svn checkout https://svn.ik.nu/wokkel/branches/wokkel-muc-client-support-24 wokkel

* Patch it:
(cd wokkel; patch -p0 < ../wokkel.diff)

* Run:
/usr/bin/env PYTHONPATH=.:wokkel twistd -y main.py -n

In current version it sends all messages from IRC to Jabber channel.
And from Jabber to IRC it sends only messages that are prepended with "@toirc ".

Fix it appropriately to satisfy your needs :)
